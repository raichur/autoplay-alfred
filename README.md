# AutoPlay for Alfred

Automatically plays music from a folder in VLC. 

## Usage:
- Just type ``q NAMEOFFOLDER``. For example, ``q EDM`` or ``q Classical`` and it will start playing.

## Setup:
- Edit the AppleScript to open the URL where your music folder is. For example, mine is ``OpenURL "file:///Users/josh/Documents/Consume/Music/" & q & "/"`` (that's where I have folders separated by genre).
